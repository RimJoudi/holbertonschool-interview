# 0x11-heap_sort
This interview algorithm project works with the heap sort algorithm.

[Heap Sort](/0x11-heap_sort/0-heap_sort.c)
* Write a function in C `void heap_sort(int *array, size_t size)` sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Heap Sort algorithm:
  * must implement the sift-down heap sort algorithm
  * expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements
  * write in file [0-O](/0-O) the big O notations of the time complexity of the Heap Sort algorithm:
    * in the best case
    * in the average case
    * in the worst case
